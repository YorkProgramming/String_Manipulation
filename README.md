String Manipulation Functions

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript functions for manipulating strings. These functions perform various operations such as removing blanks, extracting digits, creating acronyms, counting non-space characters, and removing shorter strings from an array.

Functions:

1. `removeBlanks(str)`: Removes all spaces from the input string and returns the modified string.
2. `getDigits(str)`: Extracts and returns a numeric value by concatenating all the digits found in the input string.
3. `acronym(str)`: Generates an acronym by taking the first letter of each word in the input string and returning it in uppercase.
4. `countNonSpaces(str)`: Counts and returns the number of non-space characters in the input string.
5. `removeShorterStrings(arr, num)`: Removes strings from the input array that have a length less than the specified number and returns a new array.
